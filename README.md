# supreme-wah
This is the hello-world repo from the tutorial exercise from guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I'm having a fit of repeated tutorial-doing, so I already have a hello-world repo and needed a new name. "Hello-world2" seems a bit boring. GitHub kindly suggested "supreme waddle", but I had a sad morning and so "wah" replaced "waddle." Thanks GitHub :)
